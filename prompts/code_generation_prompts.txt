## Game Architecture
```
Build modular game structure:
- Game state management
- Object management system
- Collision detection
- Input handling
- Results system
- Clean separation of concerns
```

## Player Movement
```
Implement smooth movement:
- Continuous movement while keys held
- Instant direction changes
- Boundary checking
- Touch controls for mobile
- 60 FPS smooth animation
```

## Object System
```
Create object spawning:
- Random positioning
- Object type selection
- Performance-based difficulty
- Object lifecycle management
- Memory-efficient creation
```

## Collision Detection
```
Build collision system:
- Bounding box detection
- Different object responses
- Performance optimization
- Clean object removal
- Accurate hit detection
```

## Results System
```
Create dynamic results:
- Performance-based categories
- Educational content
- Easy-to-modify system
- Image and quote display
- Personalized feedback
```

## Performance
```
Optimize for performance:
- 60 FPS target
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Memory management
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile optimization
